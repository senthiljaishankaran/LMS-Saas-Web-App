Initialising Backend
-> npm init -y
-> npm i bcryptjs cookie-parser cors dotenv express ioredis jsonwebtoken mongoose  
    envalid
    Above dependencies are used at production also so they are installed as 
    prod dependency
-> npm i --save-dev @types/bcryptjs @types/cookie-parser @types/cors @types/express 
    @types/jsonwebtoken @types/node ts-node-dev typescript

Note:
    refer chatgpt chat history to know the detailed  explanation of each and every dependencies described above,below i have noted some only

    creating a typescript config file:
        npx tsc --init (this will generate a tsconfig.json file)

    bcrypt:
        bcrypt is a password hashing function designed to be slow and computationally intensive, making it more resistant to brute-force attacks. 
        It is commonly used to securely store passwords in databases. 
        The name "bcrypt" stands for "Blowfish crypt," as it was originally based on the Blowfish encryption algorithm.

        difference b/t bcryptjs and bcrypt:
            bcrptjs is implemented using javascript and not on c binding where the bcrypt is implemented using the native c binding so this is fater than bcryptjs
    
    what is @types/dependency means?
        @types/express or any dependecy is dependency that helps typescript understand the types of the class, function and objects used from the module,also @types/ should only be installed in dev dependency environment

    cookie-parser:
        cookie-parser is a middleware that helps parse HTTP request cookie

    Cross Object resource sharing(CORS):
        Normally in any browser like chrome or firefox the request from one domain can't access the resource form the other domain, CORS on other hand used to relax this rule in a controlled way
            working:
                In the request header we pass the "Allow-Control-Access-Origin" so that the "same-origin" policy in relaxed as it allows the cors with this type of header
    
    JWT:    
        JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and URL-safe way to securely transmit information as a JSON object between parties,JWT is often used to secure RESTful APIs because it can be used to authenticate a client that wants to access the APIs.
    
    ts-node:
        It is a typescript compiler used to compile the typescript file to javascript file on the fly without the need for the separate step
            ie : 'npx tsc' will convert ts to js file but ts-node helps in doing it on the fly
        
        diff b/t ts-node & ts-node-dev:
            ts-node-dev dependency is a extension of ts-node feature that does the job of the ts-node automatically whenever there is change in the code is detected
        
        Note:
            "dev":"ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only server.js"
            we have added the above in the script area of package.json file 
            Reason:
                we know that ts-node-dev is used to autmatically convert the ts file to js file --respawn and --transpile-only are the parameters used with the ts-node-dev dependency

                --respawn in ts-node-dev is used ts-node-dev will automatically restart the application

                --transpile-only used to skips type checking and only transpiles TypeScript files
    
    ioredis:
        Popular Node.js library used for working with Redis, which is an in-memory data structure store,redis is often used as a caching mechanism, message broker, and general-purpose key-value store. 
    
    envalid:
        envalid helps ensure that your application's configuration is correctly set up and avoids common issues related to missing or improperly configured environment variables. It's especially useful in environments like containers or platforms where configuration is often provided through environment variables.

    CaptureStackTrace in Node js:
        call stack is data structure that keeps track of sequence of function calls that has been made in course of execcuting the program

        capture stack trace refers to the process of collecting information about the current call stack of a program at a particular point in time.

        Each function call is represented by a stack frame

        when explicitly requested, Node.js can capture a stack trace to provide information about where the error or specific point of interest in the code occurred.

        captureStackTrace() is amethod available in Error class to provide it
    
    Middle-ware function:
        It refers to functions or pieces of software that have access to the request and response objects in an HTTP application. Middleware functions can perform various tasks, modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware in the stack.

        Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined, and they play a crucial role in handling HTTP requests in a modular and extensible way
    
    Error Handling Brief:(approach in this project)
        Here we use an Error handler that extends Error class ,also we define the custom constructor with message property available in error class and a new
        property called status code to define the error of how it will be looking

        Then we used middle-ware(it will have object related to res,req,next and an error) to extract and use the parameters for validation and create a new error using the error handler that we created

        Then an simple async function error handler in re-usable and concise code with out try,catch block
